RideWise:Predicting Bike-Sharing Demand Based on Weather and Urban Events

Project Statement:
The goal of this project is to build machine learning regression models to predict city bike-sharing demand. The
primary objectives are to forecast daily or hourly rental counts for a city’s bike-sharing system based on a
combination of historical bike usage data, weather information, and details of city events or activities. This project
aims to help urban planners and transit operators make better decisions regarding fleet management and distribution
in response to demand patterns.

Use Cases: The project addresses two primary use cases:
Predicting Bike-Sharing Demand:
• Description: Using historical usage records, weather conditions, and scheduled city events, predict
the number of bike rentals for a given day or hour. This supports operational decisions in fleet
rebalancing, station stocking, and anticipating surges during special events or adverse weather.
Assessing Impact of Features:
• Description: Use the trained model to understand how factors such as weather variations, city events,
or neighbourhood characteristics affect demand. This helps in understanding and optimizing
ridership patterns and planning for infrastructure improvements.
